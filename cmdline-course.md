# An introduction

The idea of the course is to teach you how to work around in the command line environment, and how to use the tools it offers to make working, with files for example, easier and faster. The course syllabus is divided into seven weeks, each of which introduces a new topic, and the course ends in a final project.

A table to access the contents of the course:

|Week      |Topic      |
|----------|---------
|`1` | [Introduction to Command Line Environments](#week-1)
|`2` | [Navigating a UNIX system](#week-2)
|`3` | [Basic Corpus Processing](#week-3)

## Week 1

**Introduction to Command Line Environments**

The first week teaches you how to set up a command line environment, as well as some basic commands. You also learn about directories and textfiles, and how to move them between directories and how to edit them.

*During the week I learned...* what an operating system is, and about the history and difference between Linux and Unix. On the more practical side I learned how to fetch content from the internet with the command wget, and how to view a text file with the commands cat and less. I also learned how to create and change directories and how to use the emacs text editor.

**Some of the commands I learned:**
* wget
* cd
* ls
* mv
* less
* cp
* mkdir
* rm

## Week 2

**Navigating a UNIX System**

On the second week, you learn more about the UNIX file system. You learn how to copy and delete, as well as move and rename directories. You also learn about processes and the standard system directories, and how the privacy of users is being protected by different permissions.

*During the week I learned...*

**Some of the commands I learned:**
* cp -R
* rmdir
* which
* kill
* ssh

## Week 3
